## How to use Repositories
# DONT PANIC!!! YOU DO NOT NEED TO KNOW HOW TO USE GIT TO USE THIS!!!!
1. Create a github account if you dont already have one.
2. Either clone this repositiory or download it as a zip using the button on the top right of the screen. 
3. Please Watch this repository (button on the top right) and you will be notified when the repository changes. This will let you know that I have updated the files.
## How to Use/ find things in this filestructure
All files relevant to the project are housed within folders that contain the different parts of the project as a whole. As additional assets are created, the folders will be removed from the Unused filestructures and moved into the project folder.
## OK... but where is the Resolume stuff?
Inside the "resolume files" folder you will find the most recent versions of the resolume compositions and configuration for the rhombonyx stage. You will need both of these, along with instructions for how and where the files go on your local system. In general, you will want to install the contents of the /config/ folder into your resolume folder before you try to open any of the compositions.
